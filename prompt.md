OpenSpur is a protocol that fairly prices work contributed towards a goal. Founders propose problems to be solved and outline a solution. This forms a dependency graph.
The community then contributes funds towards solving sub-problems or actual work.
Every contribution then equates to a share in the system. Everytime someone pays to use the system created using this method, every contributor gets a percentage of the sale.

Here are some quoates about what entrepreneurs are currently complaining about.

"Lack of stability -- one day you are a star, another day you think that you will die without a penny"

Allocation of time and resources. There’s so much noise around, staying focused, making effective and quick decisions and knowing where to allocate time will always be an area that I focus on.

Lack of time

Lack of money

Lack of expertise

Lack of motivation
