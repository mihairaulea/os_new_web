BEFORE

The current way of doing things feels broken

*** Lack of stability

Lean startup or else - no way to really know if what you're working on is worth it. Often, entrepreneurs need to take on smaller visions to account for funding gaps.

*** Talent gaps

Innovation happens when new processes unlock - in case of a scientific discovery. Or when new ideas are put together in novel ways. We prohibit innovation by locking up people that should be working together in different offices and companies. 

*** No control over schedule

We start companies because we have something new to offer to the world. Too often, we end up doing nothing of what we are good at and enjoy doing in favour of doing admin work.

Record and protect your ideas

AFTER

A fair remuneration protocol.
Fair
Some challenges are too big for one individual. Even for one team or one organization. Together, we can solve bigger problems. But we can never come together without the trust layer and the proper incentives for everyone involved.
Transparent
Complete visibility into all work produced and all money spent. This helps us all make better decisions. Gain visibility into how much concrete was used in all construction projects. Now we all know how much value an alternative solution to concrete has and if construction companies would adopt it, so we can build it.
Borderless and permisionless
Innovation comes from old ideas put together in novel ways. The bigger the scale and attention from professionals from diverse backgrounds, the more likely we are to form an innovative solution to today's pressing problems. We don't care where the knowledge or the work comes from as long as we get the job done.
